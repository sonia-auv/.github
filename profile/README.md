SONIA (Système d’Opération Nautique Intelligent et Autonome) is a student-run technical club from École de technologie supérieure since 1999. Its members have built 9 AUVs so far to compete at the annual RoboSub event hosted by RoboNation, Inc. (formerly known as the AUVSI Foundation).

The team firmly believes in learning and sharing ideas with the community through contributions and thus, we leverage open-source projects enhancing our visibility.
